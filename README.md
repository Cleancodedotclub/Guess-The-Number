"Python Guess the Number" is a simple console-based game where the computer generates a random number and the player tries to guess the number within a limited number of attempts. The game prompts the player to enter a guess and provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low. The player wins if they guess the number within the allotted attempts, otherwise, they lose. This game is implemented using Python programming language and is suitable for beginners who are just starting to learn programming. The repository contains the source code for the game along with a README file providing instructions on how to run the game.
